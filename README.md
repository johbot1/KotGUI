# KotGUI
One of three Kotlin related projects for my final semester, this one a GUI project. This was a fun project, if only for the fact that I got to interact with javax swing. I like how easy it was to quickly get a template going and skeletonize what I want and how I want it. One major issue with this project, was the resetting of the active number to be able to quickly go into a new equation after hitting the equals sign. The easiest was the implementation of the positive negative button, which simply multiplied the active number by -1 to change it's sign! All in all, I liked the simplicity of this project and how quick I was able to complete it.
